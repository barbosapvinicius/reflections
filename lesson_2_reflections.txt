What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It starts to create all versions of the files in this directory. We need 
it because that's the first step to start doing it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

It's different just in terms of placement, because it works as a meantime to 
files in working directory to the repository. The value of this is you can plan better
what repositories to build.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use it to make the changes in the files I want to change and to have better control
of what I'm changing.
