What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It starts to create all versions of the files in this directory. We need 
it because that's the first step to start doing it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

It's different just in terms of placement, because it works as a meantime to 
files in working directory to the repository. The value of this is you can plan better
what repositories to build.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use it to make the changes in the files I want to change and to have better control
of what I'm changing.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

I believe branches would help me if I want to run some test or do something different
instead of just making the code better.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

These diagrams helps me showing exactly the way it works for all
branches. Great way to understand better this structure.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is the merge of the branch you checked out and the branch you
wanted to merge with. Because it's better to visualize how the main branch
is going to be after the merge.
