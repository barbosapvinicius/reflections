When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I believe it's better to use it here when you want or need to share this archive with
other people, and later on download it to the local work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe I would do this because we only want to commit after the changes we made
are significant, just like the automatic commit on Git.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks and clones are very similar because both make copies of the files and 
all history of commits, but forks should only be used in GitHub and clones can be
used in Git, to clone from Git or GitHub. Branches is different because it's a new path after some
commit, so it's not so similar to forks and clones.
